The collection consisted of roughly 20,000 books and 17,000 manuscripts that had impacts on the evolution of medicine and science. This donation from the Lily Family inspired then-IU President Herman B Wells to construct the Lily Library which opened its doors in October of 1960.[^2]

## From the Contributor
> *I've, since a very young child, been very interested in how the world works and I learned at some point that you can make a living that way. Very rarely do young children get exposed to the thought that they can do something that they really love to do.*
