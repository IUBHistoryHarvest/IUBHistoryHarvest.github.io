## About This Object

This is a homemade shirt that was made on a First Thursday.  These shirts represent what comes with a First Thursday, Creativity!  [First Thursdays(https://artsandhumanities.indiana.edu/council-programs/first-thursdays/index.html)] are a great way to check out new clubs and events around IU.  These shirts represent what the girls had on their mind and what they wanted to put on the T-shirts.  To learn more about First Thursdays, check them out on their website, as well as looking for flyers around campus.
