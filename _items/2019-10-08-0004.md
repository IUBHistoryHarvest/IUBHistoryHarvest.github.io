## About This Object

This is an iPhone X. It is a model that came back out a few years ago and has already been surpassed by iPhone 11.

## From the Contributor

So if I lose my phone, I lose everything I own in one shot, including my house keys which are right there. And then my IU ID, my debit card, my license. You have a lot of faith in this phone. I do have a lot of faith in this phone but it's always with me. Except for that time when it fell in the ocean.
