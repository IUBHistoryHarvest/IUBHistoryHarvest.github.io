## About This Object

A ticket stub from Berlin's subway, dated to summer of 2019.

<p class="blockquote">I like to travel and this is a subway ticket from Berlin, from my first time traveling in Europe.  I tend to keep all the little things that I collect when I travel. it was my first time traveling in Europe and I really liked Berlin so it has memories attached to it and that’s why it’s significant. {% if page.itemcontributor %}<br><strong>—{{ page.itemcontributor }}</strong>{% endif %}</p>
