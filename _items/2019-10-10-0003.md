## About This Item
This is a blue eco-friendly water bottle with an image of a kayak on it. The contributor got this from REI in Indianapolis, and covered it in stickers to add her own personal touch to it. 

## From the Contributor
<p class=blockquote style=’font-size:115%;’> It’s important to use reusable products because I like the outdoors. [This bottle] kinda just goes along with the low maintenance vibe of being like progressive and caring about the environment. I have a sticker that’s Picture Organic Living. It’s a company in France that makes coats and ski equipment and stuff out of recycled goods. I have like the REI co-op sticker which, honestly, I don’t really know what that means but I’m a member of it. I have a sticker from like Vans cause those are shoes I like to wear so I slap those on there. Then I have another sticker that says ‘a life outdoors is a life well lived’ and that’s also from REI.</p>
