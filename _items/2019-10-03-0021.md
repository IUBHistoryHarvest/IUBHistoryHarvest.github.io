## From the Contributor
>So when you are in the circle you are a participant. When you're in the circle you're a participant. There's no such thing as an audience, no one is removed from the performance. The plate I think kind of represents the ethos of samba, in that it's a circular communal event. It's also a humble instrument, and rural samba musicians are usually farmers, working class people. Samba is famously versatile, so you know, even if you don't have an instrument you can still play--you can clap your hands, you can dance, you can tap your feet. {% if page.itemcontributor %}**â€”{{ page.itemcontributor }}**{% endif %}
