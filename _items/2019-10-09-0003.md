## About This Item
This is the contributor’s first library card that she got when she was just five years old, and now she is a librarian herself! It was also the start of her library card collection, which consists of cards from places she has traveled in Europe. 

## From the Contributor
<p class=blockquote style=’font-size:115%;’>Now the library is called the Lake Elsinore Public Library which is part of Riverside county public library system and they no longer make these cards anymore so it’s a collector’s edition, very special. I wasn’t really a big reader when I was a kid. And I don’t think I really discovered libraries until I got to college and just valued having the space - especially public libraries. Actually, when I studied abroad in Sweden I started going to the library there because Sweden is very expensive. I ran out of money in like a couple of weeks so I spent a lot of time at the public library because I knew I could go there for free, figured nobody would ask me any questions, and I could just hide out and do my thing there. So that’s when I kinda woke up and went “oh, libraries are a pretty cool thing” and that was the start of sorta set me on the path to becoming a librarian. </p>
