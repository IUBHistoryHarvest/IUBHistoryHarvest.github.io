## About This Object

This is a book, titled *The Intro Guide to a Sex Positive You: Lessons Tales and Tips,** written by the contributor. It was published last year, and it is about sex-positivity. 

## From the Contributor

>It is a guide to recognizing your identities, then to learning how to communicate, set, and respect boundaries, and then finally how to explore your sexuality in order to find confidence in yourself and in your intimate relationships. I wrote this because I experienced my own sexually negative, sexually traumatic experience at that time and so this is for anyone who has had those kinds of experiences, so they can reclaim their sexuality, for those who would like to avoid them, and for those who would like to avoid creating those for other people. So, just the whole idea of having a positive sex out there rather than anything shameful, harmful, or hurtful. {% if page.itemcontributor %}**â€”{{ page.itemcontributor }}**{% endif %}
