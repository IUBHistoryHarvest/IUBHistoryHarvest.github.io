## About This Item
This "Happy Birthday" banner has been used in numerous birthdays here at Indiana University over the last 20 years. Julie is normally the one who plans the celebrations that take place in her office at IU, and this banner is one of the reminders of the celebrations and enjoyable times that her department has had over the years, despite being in a room where the offices are cubes. 

>*Well generally the current office I’m in is a cube farm so there’s forty, fifty cubes in a single area and you'll get some murmurings and some talking occasionally but most the time it is really, really unusually quiet for having so many people in it and then as soon as any sort of party or gathering happens all of a sudden there's just like a cacophony of noise everyone's chit-chatting and talking and laughing and a lot of times there's food or there's, you know, silly decorations like this and it's just it's a lot more fun when something like that’s happening so it gets a lot louder.*

## Celebrations as a Sense of Belonging
Today, we have numerous, countless, celebrations that give one a sense of belonging. Whether that belonging is to a particular group, community, culture, etc., chances are there is a celebration that takes place for them in the form of a festival, parade, cake-cutting, dance, the list goes on. Celebrations give us a way to express how we feel towards a particular group, object, person, location, entity, and one of those example are birthdays.

Celebrating a birthday can give a sense of belong to the one whose birthday it is by the riturals present in the celebration. For instance, tradition usually involves candles being lit, songs being sung, and following the songs, the candles are blown out. Cutting the cake, sharing it, and consuming it all follow, with maybe some variations regarding who cuts and serves the cake. After the above has taken place, the "ritual" is complete, as is the celebration of the birthday. From this ritual, the person celebrating their birthday is surrounded by those who are close to them: friends, family, significate others, pets, and a sense of belonging to this group of people is felt on a level that may not be a daily occurance.[^1]

These celebrations can also help remind us of our own histories and communities that we choose to belong to. They remind us that we are social by nature, choosing to surround ourself with those who are close to us, that we belong to certain groups, cultures, and backgrounds, and that celebrations can gives us way to express our gratitude, cultural heritage, and feelings towards others.
