## About This Object

This is a vanilla latte iced coffee from Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf cafe in Wells Library. It helps the contributor to stay focussed while studying, especially during midterms. 

## From the Contributor

>Around this time of school year I get very fatigued and tired from studying. I’m studying for two midterms that I have this week and one next week. I’m usually at Wells for the entire day after my classes, so coffee keeps me going and keeps me focused so I can study better and longer. {% if page.itemcontributor %}**—{{ page.itemcontributor }}**{% endif %}
