It’s like a restaurant that has a lot of history. It was a Prohibition era bar, and they got shut down and then had to move around New York City a bunch of times. Eventually they relocated, and now if you go there on your twenty-first birthday, they give you a hat. So it wasn’t my twenty-first birthday, but I did manage to get a hat from somebody. Now me and my sister both have them, and it’s a very sentimental thing.It was actually this past May. My Mom really likes Billy Joel, and we went to Billy Joel’s concert for his birthday. We went to the restaurant before. It was also his birthday the day that he performed, so it kind of lined upI actually went out and bought [my buddy Max here] a hat. It says twenty-one on it, and I had it made, so he didn’t feel left out. So it’s, like, an inclusive thing now. And it’s very coveted. You can’t really get it, it’s not easy to track down. That’s why I identify with it."
