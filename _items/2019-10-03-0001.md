It was a Prohibition era bar, and they got shut down and then had to move around New York City a bunch of times. Eventually they relocated, and now if you go there on your twenty-first birthday, they give you a hat. So it wasn’t my twenty-first birthday, but I did manage to get a hat from somebody. Now me and my sister both have them, and it’s a very sentimental thing. {% if page.itemcontributor %}**—{{ page.itemcontributor }}**{% endif %}
