## About This Object

Kimonos like these date back historic times in East Asia for both men and women. In the days and years since World War II, especially in more modern times, they have become a symbol of traditional Japaneseness for women. While men’s attire has taken to the Western standard of suits and ties for their "Coming of Age" Day celebrated on the 15th of January each year, women’s attire has stayed traditional in the form or dawning a Kimono for the occasion.

>My great grandfather was in World War II. He enlisted in 1943, went to Japan, and brought this back with him. When I was 16, I went on a student trip to Japan and he gave me this beautiful Kimono. {% if page.itemcontributor %}**—{{ page.itemcontributor }}**{% endif %}

## Kimonos and Culture
### A History Harvest Perspective

Kimonos have been a huge part of Japanese culture and here is a little secret about kimonos you may have not known about.

Many Kimonos used for this celebration can cost upwards of ¥1,000,000 (roughly $9,200 USD), and lead women to have long, exhausting days of preparation for their "Coming of Age" Celebration, a wedding, funeral, etc. One example of this is shown in a scene from Madame Butterfly preformed at Indiana University. In it, you can see a women donning a more casual Kimono with her hair and makeup complete, while a man stands in a Western suit.

Kimonos are a certain identity for Japan that reaches other continents world-wide.  As these aren't common as before, they are still very proudly worn in different scenarios.  When reading **Kimono and the Construction of Gendered and Cultural Identities** it tells not only about the history but more on how kimonos play into the culture of Japan.  To learn more on Japanese culture, Indiana University Southeast has a [Japan Center](https://www.ius.edu/japan-center/index.html) for students, staff, faculty, and the public to learn more on the Japanese culture.
