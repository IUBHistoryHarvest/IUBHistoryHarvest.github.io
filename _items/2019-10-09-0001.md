## About This Item
This pin has a picture of the contributor’s friend, who got her PhD, on it and says, “That’s Doctor to you.” She got it from her friend’s graduation party as a party favor. She keeps it on her backpack to remind herself that getting a PhD is possible and that it is something to celebrate.

## From the Contributor
<p class=blockquote style=’font-size:115%;’>When I was in undergrad, which wasn’t [at IU], getting an undergraduate degree seemed to be framed as something I just had to do. To succeed in society right now, you should have an undergraduate degree. So I kinda took it for granted that I was going to get this degree and graduate, and when I graduated I didn’t celebrate. When I went to Lindsay’s graduation party and saw party favors, food, drinks, and lots of fun, I decided that getting a PhD is something to actually celebrate. I felt that it’d actually feel like an accomplishment when I’d finish it. So I carry this pin around on my backpack, not only to remind me of my friend Lindsay, but to remind myself that getting a PhD is something that I’m working towards, and when I’m finally done, it’s gonna be a party! </p>
