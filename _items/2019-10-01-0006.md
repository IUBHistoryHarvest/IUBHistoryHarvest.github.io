## About This Object

Guacardo is a tiny stuffed avocado with a spirit of its own - it has legs, arms, and even a silly face. The contributor got this little guy from a website for Latinx youth in the United States called “wearemitu.” This object is among a collection of other items the contributor has from this site. It represents how she has been able to stay connected with her heritage and the Latinx community despite being in an environment where the Latinx population is low.

## Preserving One’s Cultural Identity
### A History Harvest Perspective

Transitioning to college is difficult, but it is especially difficult for people who are of the minority population and lack representation in the community they are in. Could you imagine what it is like to move to a community where your culture is so underrepresented? In interviews with Latinx students show us the various experiences of adjusting to college life at Indiana University. A common theme across these interviews is how they kept their Latinx identities while still being a Hoosier.[^1] 

Another solution to preserving your cultural identity is by using digital media outlets, such as twitter, facebook, and other websites. The internet allows for intercultural communication to be easy. With this new type of media, you can keep in touch with your family and friends, express opinions, and stay connected with your culture. Technology has a strong impact on one’s identity, and when used to continue to learn about and be a part of one’s culture, one’s cultural identity is actually strengthened.[^2] Guacardo’s contributor figured this out when she came to Indiana University, where the Latinx population is only 4% of the student population, by engaging with the “wearemitu” community.[^3]
