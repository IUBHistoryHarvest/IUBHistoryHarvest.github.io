#### Recipes That Go a Long Way

When thinking of different groups of people in society, [Puerto Ricans and Hawaiians](https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/centrovoices/chronicles/how-first-puerto-ricans-arrived-hawai%E2%80%99i-island) don't necessarily come to mind.  In 1899, a sugar shortage came about once hurricanes wrecked havoc through Puerto Rico.  Plantation workers were then sent to Hawaii and arrived in 1901 and have been going strong since.  Now with over 40,000 Puerto Ricans spread across four different islands, these two great cultures have merged and created some [icon food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qnI7QTjwz4) around the island.  Great dishes have been merged together and much has been created since coming to the island.  This cookbook has all of that and more, especially when wanting some of that great cultural flavor.
