## About This Item
This is a small, elastic bound notebook that the contributor got his freshman year here at IU. He got it right here in Bloomington, at TIS. He was inspired to get one by one of his comedian friends who has one and uses it to write down any jokes he thinks of, but the contributor himself uses this one to write down any ideas he randomly gets throughout the day. He carries it with him in his backpack at all times. 

## From the Contributor
<p class=blockquote style=’font-size:115%;’> It’s one of those things where a thought comes to mind and you’re like ‘oh I don’t want to forget about that in case I want to like expand on it later,’ so then you write it down. I would say I’m a pretty positive kinda guy, I always look for the funny side of things because I don’t like to dwell on negative stuff. So I’ll try to take something awkward or sad and try to lighten the mood by writing down funny ideas or sketches that can be expanded on later. It reflects my positive, humorous attitude.</p>
