## About This Item
This alebrije is carved from wood in the shape of a cat, and painted in vivid colors. They are created in Oaxaca, Mexico to respresent what the creator dreams about. This one here was created by a local artist from Oaxaca which Erika purchased while there for a close friend. 
>*Alebrije are from Oaxaca and alebrije came from someone's dreams..., he dreamt about animals, about monsters with different colors, in history. So when he woke up the next day, he said that he was starting to draw these figures. Then later he decided to so some carving.*
