## About This Object

This is a La Casa t-shirt that says “Educación es Poder Education is Power,” “La Casa home away from home since 1973,” and has an IU logo on it. The contributor got it at a La Casa retreat for latinx freshman that is held at the beginning of every school year. 

## From the Contributor

>It helps me stay in touch with my community because it’s a place here on campus where latinos or latinxs are welcome to like go and hang out, study, and sleep. I see my friends all the time in the organization so it keeps me in touch. I feel like it represents all the memories and accomplishments I’ve done here in my university because of La Casa when I got involved in it freshman year. My best friend Brenda was there so I would go there often, and then I got involved in organizations like Latinos Unidos in the university which I later became president of.  I got involved in more organizations like LEC which is Latino Enhancement Cooperative and I would volunteer there a lot beginning in the first couple years like doing the colectiva dinners. {% if page.itemcontributor %}**—{{ page.itemcontributor }}**{% endif %}
