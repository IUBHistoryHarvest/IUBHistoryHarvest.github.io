Each of the artifacts below was contributed by a member of the IU community. We've tagged them as "sentimental" or "practical" artifacts according to how the contributor described that artifact's significance to them.

In addition to a collection of artifacts, our class also built on the patterns in contributed artifacts to write a [few histories of IU's community]({{ site.baseurl }}/stories/).
