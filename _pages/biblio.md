## Network Analysis

Network analysis is a research method which uses nodes (points) and edges (lines) to visually display connections across objects, people, places, events, and ideas. We used this method to find important connections within the data derived from our History Harvest to investigate the relationships that define what it means to be a Hoosier.

## Text Analysis

Text analysis is a method of analyzing patterns of word usage. By treating words as data, we can find the most common words (term frequency), or the most important topics (topic modeling) in a body of text. We used a program called Voyant to build word clouds and other interactive visualizations that illustrate word frequencies within the oral histories of harvested objects.

## Mapping

Digital mapping data records the spatial placement of objects, people, and events. For our History Harvest, we used Clio to map out where contributed artifacts came from. By displaying objects within their original context, we can learn more about what locations mean a lot when it comes to defining Hoosier life.
