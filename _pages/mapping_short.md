# Mapping

>An interesting block quote from an undergraduate about their process and learning will go here and look beautiful.

In the “who, when, where, how” questions of history, historical mapping data gets at the heart of answering the “where”. Location in space is not just something that’s important for large-scale events such as battles and disasters. Everyday historical objects like a collection of family recipies, an heirloom, or a  mural can be defined through their production and connection to a specific place. Asking questions about objects like when they were created, where, and by who can be very important for historians in understanding the daily lives of everyday people. Mapping this data can help us to find or illustrate its spatial patterns, and tell a larger story about a place and its people. Collecting items and testimony connected to a place gives us the mapping data. With the mapping data, we can create dynamic visualizations like story maps that tell larger stories of place, community, and change over time. How would you connect a personal posseession to a place or places? 

For our History Harvest, we used Clio to help tell our objects' stories and their connection to Bloomington. By mapping out in space where our objects came from and displaying objects within their original context, we can learn more about what locations mean when it comes to defining Hoosier life and why.
