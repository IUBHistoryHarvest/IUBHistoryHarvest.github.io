As digital history students, we studied three domains of methods for analysis of historical data:  Text Analaysis, Mapping, and Network Analysis.
- Text Analysis gave us a larger overview of transcripts of oral history interviews and how they relate to one another.
- Mapping connected us spatially with the larger world, helping us to see geographic connections between Bloomington and other parts of the world.
- Network Analysis helped us visualize the History Harvest objects and their connections to one another, broadening our understanding of how relationships among these objects are situated in a social, political, and cultural context.
