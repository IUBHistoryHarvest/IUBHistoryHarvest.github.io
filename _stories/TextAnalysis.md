## Research Question

- How can the analysis of diction and syntax help researchers connect seemingly different individuals or groups?

By dissecting the transcribed interviews of our history harvest participants, we, in turn, have started to build a broader understanding of descriptive speech patterns, specifically regarding their unique objects. Whether it be varying socio-economic, political, geographic, or cultural backgrounds—the individuals consistently attached sentimental meanings to objects of all shapes and sizes. Understanding the relationship between owner and object, particularly the way the owner speaks about said object, is key to understanding how the pair interact daily. With this information in mind, we aim to pair interactions and descriptive speech patterns together. Essentially, we are slowly creating a model that would predict how unlike individuals could come together over similar feelings, actions, and object use. With the city of Bloomington as our example, we intend to identify and explain any trends that present themselves successfully.

## Process of analysis

- Collection of transcripts

The collection of the transcripts went smoothly. Thanks to the class, and additional help transcribing the interviews fairly early along in the process, it was as simple as having a file full of them added to our Text Analysis Box folder. 

- Separate objects into three different groups: *Apparel, Household items and Miscellaneous*

The creation of object groups and separation of said groups was not demanding. Although, it was time-consuming to carefully think the groups that best represented the body of objects, and in turn, sort them accordingly.

- Group and upload transcripts onto *Voyant*

Uploading our transcripts into Voyant was simple… but not at first. This was an area that the group struggled with initially. The reason for this? Unfamiliarity with the tool at hand. We weren’t exactly sure how to approach uploading multiple transcripts into Voyant. Originally, we decided to sort all transcripts according to item type and then copy and paste them into one single document for the group. This sounded good at the time but presented challenges later in the process. Eventually, we had to add transcripts as they were finishing up the transcribing process. Because of this, we needed to add to our documents. But—what had we already added to this mega-document, and what had we not added? How would we get these new documents into our existing Voyant pages? While it was possible to sort through what was already in the documents and add to our existing Voyant pages, it was a very tedious task. Learning from our mistakes, we eventually sorted the items by transcript—but put each unique document into folders for each category. Finally, we downloaded these folders from Box and uploaded entire folders at a time to Voyant.

- Make a list of *stop words* for each of the different groups using Voyant

In computing, stop words are the most commonly used words in a language. In turn, it only logically makes sense that stop word lists are sorted out before the processing of the natural language data. Removing them before running the data provides a more clean and efficient use of a program like Voyant. However, it should be stated that stop word lists are ironic. Our group expected them to be relatively straight forward and provide definite results. Yet, the stop word lists did present some challenges initially. While the use of different curvy quotes such as ‘vs.’ usually is not even recognized by human readers, computers will always catch it. Consequently, we learned that we needed to double-check our stop word lists for both sets of curvy quotes to avoid skipping over any common conjunctions that used an odd curvy quote. Additionally, we realized that there is no such thing as a complete stop word list. When should you stop? What is too specific, and is that even a thing? To combat that uncertainty, we elected to create basic stop lists for our three categories of household, apparel, and miscellaneous. From there, we expanded them based on their specific words.

## Object Groups: Apparel, Household items, Miscellaneous items

*Apparel*

*Miscellaneous*

This Section was filled with items that were considered a majority of different random items that people had. Form keychains to photocards, these items all represented the people and their personal identities while also connecting them to the people within the city of Bloomington. During my study, I found that most miscellaneous items were ones that people retrieved from areas outside Bloomington at some point in their life. However, it connects with the people who had miscellaneous things in Bloomington because they both provided a sense of comfort for each individual. 

The objects are divided in three different secitons: apparels, household objects, and other miscellaneous items. 

Several paragraphs, some of them adapted from your individual research on your objects, go here. Think about the connections from your secondary sources and how some of the other objects from our history harvest fit those connections.
