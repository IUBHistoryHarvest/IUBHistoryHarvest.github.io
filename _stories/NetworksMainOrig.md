# Network analysis as a way to understand the global shape of the IU Community

Everything around us is connected. In the same way that a map shows how roads connect places together, “networks” show how people, events, objects, places, and even ideas are connected together by the relationships between them. Network analysis is a way of visualizing this interconnectedness and noticing what might be less obvious otherwise.

An interesting block quote from an undergraduate about their process and learning will go here and look beautiful.

We build networks by putting together “nodes” (points) and “edges” (the lines connecting points). Every node in the network represents one thing, whether it’s the Declaration of Independence, Beyoncé, a flower pot, September 11th, or love. Every edge connecting two nodes represents a relationship, showing that the two things are connected in some way. As we analyze a network, we can see how important a given node might be based on the number of its edges, which tells us how connected it is to other nodes. Finding the most important nodes and connections helps us discover a broader story - a story that might only appear when we look at the interconnected whole as more than simply a sum of its parts!

We used a program called Net.Create to analyze the network data from our History Harvest, but anyone can make their own network with just a pen and a piece of paper. Try drawing your social network as it exists today, with you at the center and your friends and family (and anyone else you are connected with) as nodes connected to you (and potentially, each other!). How would you draw the same network from a point in your childhood? When you compare your two networks, how might they help you see changes to your social networks over time?

*Fig. 1: One group hand-sketched a base model on a blackboard (digital recreation shown above) depicting how objects, their contributors, and their significance might link together to see how they would all connect to a larger sense of community here at Indiana University. Using this model, the student researchers were able to explore how seemingly different objects all came together here at Indiana University, from their different cultural backgrounds and different locations around the world. This led us to divide our objects based on their cultural context, individuality, and/or location of origin. Not all of the objects fell into all three of the categories; some only fell into one.*

A second group started with a looser taxonomy using objects, locations, and tags as nodes with a looser "is connected to..." edge type. This research group's goal was to see connections between the objects and the tags develop as they entered data from the collected objects. Our method was for each group member to focus on one item at a time, create a node for that item, create nodes for tags and locations relating to that item, and then connect that item to those nodes. Once each member added all of the tags and locations for the object and connected them via edges, we moved on to the next object on the list.

One of the beautiful aspects of network analysis is that it allows us to use the same information in service of different approaches to create and interrogate it in a network. Take the two networks above from our class. Both groups had the same data gathered from the History Harvest. Notice that one group looked at that data and decided that one way to organize and study it was through Individual Expression and Cultural Value (Networks Group 1) and the other group decided to focus on Sentimentality (Networks Group 2) to understand Culture in Context. Think back to your two networks now, could you think of more than one way to look at your social network today? During a moment in your childhood?

Networks allow us to see the underlining connections that are not always present on the surface. When we started to collect the information given to us from the History Harvest, we learned how people and what they contributed were connected. From their interviews about their contributions, we learned multiple things: where they obtained their object, where they were from, how their object connected them to a community, and why they decided to bring that specific object to us. With all this information, we were able to start connecting the objects' journey. 

Our two questions that we ended up asking were:

- How does meaning and sentimentality factored into the objects an individual owns?
- How do objects that people and communities own reflect the societies they are in?

Above, you can see a potential model that emerges when we combine the models and patterns visible in both networks. Four areas of focus start to come together to paint the picture that the two different networks created: Object, Location, Theme, and Purpose. Group 1's focus on Individual Expression and Cultural Value highlights three of these categories: Object, Location, and Theme. The Objects and Location aspects are straight forward; what is the object and where does it come from? The Theme category is where their method of research and organization starts to come together; what do the objects have in common, or, what are their purpose?

**Group 1 research reset Kalani**

Group 2’s research explains the connection between Object, Person, and Theme, and briefly touches on the location. Here, taking the person and their object, and finding the reason the object gives them a sense of identity or community. This allowed us to see how objects were connected with a different theme than Group 1. 

Even though the approaches were different, we can see how this example from Ashley Hennessey above combines both of the networks together, giving new definitions to the edges. Let’s walk through it here, edge by edge: 

The connections that we have between the Object and Location nodes gives us the significance of the object’s location. In short, why does the location of the object matter to the object itself? Was it created or manufactured there? Was it obtained from someone important to the owner there? This connection allows us to see why the person views the locations given to us as an important location to them. 

Moving on to the connection between Theme and Location. Here we can see how the theme Group 1’s research gives us an insight into how people think of and view that location. This starts to give us more background into the creation and significance of the object to the community from which it originated.

Next is the connection between the Object and the Person. Group 2’s research focused mostly on this wi]th their question: “why is the object sentimental to the owner?” This gives the personal, one-on-one connection between the contributor and their object. What does it mean to them and why? Another fascinating aspect this gives us is when we start to see some mass-produced objects shrunk down to a personal, unique level (such as a cookbook, a kimono, or a pair of cleats).

The fourth connection we see is between the Object and the Theme, and this helps relate back to the connection between Object and Location. Here, we have the chance to see how the object’s purpose can be a representation of the theme of community. That community could be either the one it originates from or resides in now. It allows us to answer the question: “what is the cultural/societal value of the object that represents a cultural/societal theme, and how does it represent that theme?”

Lastly, we have the connection between the Theme and Person which is labeled as Individual Expression. Here, Group 1’s research and organization allow us to view how the contributors talked about their object and how they saw themselves connected with the object. It answered the question of “how do the social/cultural influences of the object tell a story about how the contributor expresses themselves?” 

From all this information, we start to see the larger, underlining connections that contributor, object, location, and theme all have in common not just within themselves, but also with other objects collected. 

Let’s take one last look at your networks. If you take Ashley’s example above, could you apply that to your social network today? Could you start to see the connections of those in your network from various locations or of significance to you that you may not have realized before? Could you see how some of them may have different connections in common other than having you? Networks give us this chance to see the larger scale that is hidden beneath, like tunnels running underground, and how those connections between objects, people, locations, and themes can all contribute to our larger understanding of belonging, identity, and community.
